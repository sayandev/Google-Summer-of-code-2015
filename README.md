Abstract: In this project under Google Summer of Code 2015, an efficient and scalable version of HPC implementation will be done using C++ programming language leveraging the powerful and rich open source libraries such as openCV, openSlide, VTK etc. to study 3D whole-slide microscopy image datasets and reconstruct 3D vessel structure to analyze serial liver slices.
